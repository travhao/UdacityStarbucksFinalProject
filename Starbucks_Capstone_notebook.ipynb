    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "The data is contained in three files:\n",

    "* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)\n",
    "* profile.json - demographic data for each customer\n",
    "* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "* id (string) - offer id\n",
    "* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "* channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "* age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "* became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "* gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)\n",
    "* id (str) - customer id\n",
    "* income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "* event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "* person (str) - customer id\n",
    "* time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "* value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can. You can access the termnal from the orange icon in the top left of this notebook.  \n",

    "You can see how to access the terminal and how the install works using the two images below.  First you need to access the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will want to run the above command:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "My main objective will be to determine whether or not the offers/discounts/informationals can drive additional revenue for Starbucks.  I'll need to understand more about how the offers were sent out (does it appear to be random?  Do certain offers tend to be sent out to specific demographics?).  I'll also need to determine whether I can create an A/B test condition where I'm able to get customers with an offer in one test group and controls without an offer in another test group.  Ideally there aren't any overlapping offers in the test/control group which could lead to confounding results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I am choosing to use A/B testing with average net revenue per customer per hour as my outcome metric used to determine success.  The reason I chose this is because 1) it takes into account rewards paid out (to ensure that any offer nets additional revenue) and 2) it equalizes the different offers and revenue.  For example, if one offer has a duration of 72 hours and another 240, then the 240 would be expected to result in a greater net revenue. However, one needs to get both values into an equal comparator variable prior to making a comparison.  Diving both by the number of hours an offer is open will do just that so that we get a net revenue per customer per hour.  With this metric, a larger number means more revenue for Starbucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use bootstrapping and confidence intervals built through bootstrapping as my final metric.  I choose bootstrapping because it allows for analysis on a non-normal distribution (which is the case for net revenue).  It also allows creation of confidence intervals that are easy to interpret for final results."

Therefore, I'll be testing a group that has this offer vs a group without and compare the average revenue per person in the control group over the 168 hours vs that of the offer group during that same 168 hours.  The offer group will have any rewards paid out subtracted from the revenue values to ensure that a positive statistical result (obtained through bootstrapping) shows that the offer brings in additional revenue after taking into account any reward revenue paid out to customers.\n",

Therefore, I'll have to remove any customers who overlap in offers.  I'll do this farther down in the code but wanted to call out here."

This will be helpful to see if the percentage getting an offer in a particular time frame varies across the different time periods where offers are being sent out.  I will want to test and just see if any offer seems to be weighted during a period. Ideally, the tests were set up with random sampling in mind and approximately the same percentage get an offer during each period.  I'll need to also do something similar with demographic variables (% female, % with missing age values, years as a member) to make sure there aren't differences in those for the offers as well."

For example, at time=0 there is no previous offer that could be impressioning upon customers.  However, at time=168 there is so any customers who received an offer that was more than 168 hours in impression time would need to be removed from the test/control data points as it has a confounding effect."
